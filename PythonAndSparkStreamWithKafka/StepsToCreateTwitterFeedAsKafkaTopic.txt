Create an App on the Twitter API website. Basically that will give you keys that you need to use the Twitter API.

Then install Kafka. Itâ€™s as simple as downloading and unzipping it.

Install Install kafka-python and twitter-python:

pip install kafka-python
pip install python-twitter
pip install tweepy

Start Zookeeper and Kafka from the Kafka install directory:

bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

Create a topic. We will create the topic for "#Metoo"

bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic metoomovement

Fill in the access keys you got from your Twitter API account and add them to this code below

See the Producer.py module

Now run it. Not only will it write messages to the screen, it will publish them to Kafka. The messages are in JSON format and will look something like

You can test that topics are getting published in Kafka by using:

bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic metomovement --from-beginning

It should echo the same output.
